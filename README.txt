The default code in my howework is using 1000 features, 10 depth and minimum 10 trees.
For analysis part, I basically add the crossvalidation part (it's in the code) and change all these numbers 
above. If you run the original code for 2000 examples, the zero-one loss you will get is
0.104 for Decision tree, 0.094 for Bagged Decision Tree,0.1025 for Random Forest and 0.0085
for Boosting Decison Tree.The maximum running time of these algorithms won't be longer than 40 minutes.
